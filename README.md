# Recommendation-System-with-Latent-Factor-Collaborative-Filter

The aim of this project is to build a Yelp Recommender System using Latent Factor Collaborative Filtering. The system will suggest businesses to users based on their past reviews and preferences using a dataset of user reviews and business information provided by Yelp. The dataset will be preprocessed and cleaned, and the system will be built using a latent factor collaborative filtering algorithm. Finally, the system will be deployed on a web application where users can enter their preferences and receive personalized recommendations. The application will provide additional information about recommended businesses, such as opening hours and location. The project will enable Yelp to provide more personalized recommendations to its users, thereby enhancing their user experience and increasing engagement with the platform.
